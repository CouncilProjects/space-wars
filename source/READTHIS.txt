Building the Project

This file contains information about building the project.

Directory Structure:

    src/: Contains the .c and .h files of the game.
    sound/: Contains the sounds and music files of the game.
    sound/: Contains the images used as textures for the game.
    libs/: Contains the needed .so files to make a self-contained version of the game for Linux
    dll/: Contains the dlls needed to make a self-contained version of the game for Windows

Makefiles: There are two Makefiles present:

    MakefileWIN for Windows
    MakefileLIN for Linux

Usage:

    To build for Windows: make -f MakefileWIN
    To build for Linux: make -f MakefileLIN

These commands will produce either an executable (.exe) for Windows or a binary for Linux on the current directory. (Requirment: the src/ directory needs to be in the same directory as the makefiles)

Creating a Self-Contained Version for Linux:

  1)  Run makeLib.sh to create a libs directory: ./makeLib.sh Space_Wars

  2)  Copy the following:
        The binary produced by make
        The sound/ and textures/ directories
        The libs/ directory
        The run.sh script

  3)  Place these items in their own folder and run the game using run.sh.

This will allow you to play the game even on fresh installations without the need for additional libraries.

Creating a Self-Contained Version for Windows:

  1) Copy the following:
        The .exe file
        The sound/ and textures/ directories
        
  2) Place them in a directory of your choice 
  
  3) Copy each .dll file from the dll/ directory (not the directory itself) and place them in the same directory as the .exe file.

This will allow you to play the game even on fresh installations without the need for additional libraries.
